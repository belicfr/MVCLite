# Configure MVCLite

Once **MVCLite** installed, let's **configure** it!

1. **Copy and paste** ``config_example.php`` and **rename** its copy to ``config.php``.
2. **Open** ``config.php`` file and **update** the information to match that of **your environment**.
3. **Copy and paste** ``.htaccess_example`` and rename its copy to ``.htaccess``.
4. **Open** ``.htaccess`` file and **update** the ``RewriteBase`` argument to match your **environment**. 
   By default, it is set to ``/``, indicating that the ``index.php`` file is located in your **server's root folder** 
   (such as ``www`` or a **similar directory**).

**MVCLite is now configured for your environment!**
