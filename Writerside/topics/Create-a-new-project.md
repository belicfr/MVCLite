# Create a new project

To begin, let's head to the **official GitHub** repository of **MVCLite**: 
[](https://github.com/belicfr/mvclite)

Navigate to the **Releases** tab to access the latest **stable** version of the framework, and download 
the latest stable version of **MVCLite**.

Once this is done, let's open the **archive file** and **copy and paste** its **content** 
to **your project root folder**.

You must have **MVCLite** framework files in your project root folder, to verify it, make sure to have 
``config_example.php`` file, for example.

**You are now ready to configure MVCLite!**
