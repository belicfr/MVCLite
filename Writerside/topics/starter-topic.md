# Introduction

**MVCLite** is a **PHP** back-end framework. Its **simplicity** and adherence to **current conventions** earn it a place 
among other frameworks. Easily create your website while enjoying a multitude of **offered features**.

This framework was born during one of my study project: create a **dynamic** website using a back-end framework. 
I wanted to create mine: here is **MVCLite**!

Although it is the result of a study project, I have had and **still maintain** the motivation to continually 
**enhance** it by incorporating new **structures**, **features**, and **systems**.

**MVCLite** is now ready to be used by any developer and will continuously stay **up-to-date** and undergo 
further **improvements**.
